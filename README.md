## ⚙️ Core Engine

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Folder = Album** | Managed via `.iphoto.album.json` manifest files. |
| **Incremental Scan** | Scans new/changed files and caches results in `.iPhoto/index.jsonl`. |
| **Live Pairing** | Auto-matches Live Photos using `ContentIdentifier` or time proximity. |
| **Reverse Geocoding** | Converts GPS coordinates into human-readable locations (e.g. “London”). |
| **Command Line Tool** | Provides a `iphoto` CLI for album init, scan, pairing, and report generation. |

---

## 🧰 Command-Line Usage

```bash
# 1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# 2️⃣ Initialize an album (creates .iphoto.album.json)
iphoto init /path/to/album

# 3️⃣ Scan files and build index
iphoto scan /path/to/album

# 4️⃣ Pair Live Photos (HEIC/JPG + MOV)
iphoto pair /path/to/album

# 5️⃣ Manage album properties
iphoto cover set /path/to/album IMG_1234.HEIC
iphoto feature add /path/to/album museum/IMG_9999.HEIC#live
iphoto report /path/to/album
```

## 🖥 GUI Interface (PySide6 / Qt6)

After installation, you can launch the full desktop interface:

```bash
iphoto-gui
```
Or directly open a specific album:

```bash
iphoto-gui /photos/LondonTrip
```
### GUI Highlights

- **Map View:** Interactive GPS clustering with tile caching.  
- **Detail Viewer:** Filmstrip navigation and playback controls.  
- **Metadata Panel:** Collapsible EXIF + QuickTime info panel.  
- **Context Menu:** Copy, Move, Delete, Restore.
## 🧱 Project Structure

The source code resides under the `src/iPhoto/` directory and is divided into two main parts — **Core Backend** and **GUI**.

---

### 1️⃣ Core Backend (`src/iPhoto/`)

This section is pure Python logic and **does not depend** on any GUI framework (such as PySide6).

| File / Module | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`app.py`** | High-level backend **Facade** coordinating all core modules, used by both CLI and GUI. |
| **`cli.py`** | Typer-based command-line entry point that parses user commands and invokes methods from `app.py`. |
| **`models/`** | Defines the main data structures such as `Album` (manifest read/write) and `LiveGroup`. |
| **`io/`** | Handles filesystem interaction, mainly `scanner.py` (file scanning) and `metadata.py` (metadata reading). |
| **`core/`** | Core algorithmic logic such as `pairing.py` (Live Photo pairing algorithm). |
| **`cache/`** | Manages disposable cache files, including `index_store.py` (read/write `index.jsonl`) and `lock.py` (file-level locking). |
| **`utils/`** | General utilities, especially wrappers for external tools (`exiftool.py`, `ffmpeg.py`). |
| **`schemas/`** | JSON Schema definitions, e.g., `album.schema.json`. |

---

### 2️⃣ GUI Layer (`src/iPhoto/gui/`)

This is the PySide6-based desktop application layer, which depends on the backend core.

| File / Module | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`main.py`** | Entry point for the GUI application (`iphoto-gui` command). |
| **`appctx.py`** | Defines `AppContext`, a shared global state manager for settings, library manager, and the backend Facade instance. |
| **`facade.py`** | Defines `AppFacade` (a `QObject`) — the bridge between the GUI and backend. It wraps the backend `app` module and uses Qt **signals/slots** to decouple backend operations (scan/import) from the GUI event loop. |
| **`services/`** | Encapsulates complex, stateful background operations such as `AssetMoveService`, `AssetImportService`, and `LibraryUpdateService`. These are coordinated by `AppFacade`. |
| **`background_task_manager.py`** | Manages the `QThreadPool`, runs tasks submitted by `services`, and handles pausing/resuming of file watchers. |
| **`ui/`** | Contains all UI components: windows, controllers, models, and custom widgets. |
| ├─ **`main_window.py`** |— Implementation of the main `QMainWindow`. |
| ├─ **`ui_main_window.py`** |— Auto-generated from Qt Designer (`pyside6-uic`), defining all widgets. |
| ├─ **`controllers/`** |— The “brain” of the GUI (MVC pattern). `main_controller.py` orchestrates all subcontrollers (e.g., `NavigationController`, `PlaybackController`) and connects all signals and slots. |
| ├─ **`models/`** |— Qt **Model-View** data models such as `AssetListModel` and `AlbumTreeModel`. |
| ├─ **`widgets/`** |— Reusable custom QWidget components such as `AlbumSidebar`, `PhotoMapView`, and `PlayerBar`. |
| └─ **`tasks/`**| — `QRunnable` implementations for background tasks, e.g., `ThumbnailLoader` and `ScannerWorker`. |

---
### 3️⃣ Map Component (`src/iPhoto/gui/maps/`)

This directory contains a semi-independent **map rendering module** used by the `PhotoMapView` widget.

| File / Module | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`map_widget/`** | Contains the core map widget classes and rendering logic. |
| ├─ **`MapWidget.py`** | Main map widget class managing user interaction and viewport state. |
| ├─ **`MapGLWidget.py`** | OpenGL-based rendering widget for efficient tile and vector drawing. |
| ├─ **`MapRenderer.py`** | Responsible for rendering map tiles and vector layers. |
| └─ **`TileManager.py`** | Handles tile fetching, caching, and lifecycle management. |
| **`style_resolver.py`** | Parses MapLibre style sheets (`style.json`) and applies style rules to the renderer. |
| **`tile_parser.py`** | Parses `.pbf` vector tile files and converts them into drawable map primitives. |
---
This modular separation ensures:
- ✅ **Backend logic** remains independent and easily testable.  
- ✅ **GUI architecture** follows MVC principles (Controllers coordinate Models and Widgets).  
- ✅ **Background tasks** are handled asynchronously for smooth user interaction.

### 4️⃣ Crop & Perspective: Coordinate Systems Definition

When working with the crop tool and perspective transformation, **three distinct coordinate systems** are used. Understanding these is critical to avoid ambiguity and ensure correct black-border prevention logic.

#### A. Original Texture Space (原始纹理坐标系)

* **Definition:** The raw pixel space of the source image file.
* **Range:** `[0, 0]` to `[W_src, H_src]` where `W_src` and `H_src` are the image dimensions in pixels.
* **Purpose:** This is the **input source** for the perspective transformation.
* **Example:** A 1920×1080 image has texture coordinates from `(0, 0)` at the top-left to `(1920, 1080)` at the bottom-right.

#### B. Projected/Distorted Space (投影空间坐标系) — **Core Calculation Space**

* **Definition:** The 2D space **after applying the perspective transformation matrix**.
* **Shape:** The original rectangular image boundary becomes an **arbitrary convex quadrilateral** in this space, denoted as `Q_valid`.
* **Crop Box State:** The user's crop box **remains an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB)** in this space, denoted as `R_crop`.
* **Critical Validation:** All **black-border prevention logic** must be performed in this space.  
  Specifically, we must verify that the crop rectangle `R_crop` is **fully contained** within the quadrilateral `Q_valid`.
* **Coordinate Range:** Typically normalized to `[0, 1]` for both dimensions.
* **Why It's Core:** This is where geometric containment checks (`rect_inside_quad`, `point_in_convex_polygon`) happen to ensure no black pixels appear in the final crop.

#### C. Viewport/Screen Space (视口/屏幕坐标系)

* **Definition:** The final pixel coordinates rendered on the screen widget.
* **Purpose:** Used **only** for handling user interaction events (mouse clicks, drags, wheel scrolls).
* **Transformation Required:** Before performing any logic calculations, screen coordinates **must be inverse-transformed** back to space **B (Projected Space)**.
* **Example:** A mouse click at `(500, 300)` on screen needs to be converted to normalized projected coordinates to determine which crop handle was clicked.

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
Always operate crop logic in **Projected Space (B)**. Screen coordinates are for input only, and texture coordinates are for rendering only. Mixing these spaces leads to incorrect cropping and visual artifacts.

---

## 🧱 Module Dependency Hierarchy

The project follows a **strict layered architecture** to ensure a clear separation between **core logic** and the **UI layer**.

### 🧩 Core Backend (Pure Python)

- **Base Layer:**  
  `utils`, `errors`, `config`, `models`, and `schemas` — foundational modules with minimal interdependencies.

- **Middle Layer:**  
  `io`, `core`, and `cache` depend on the base layer and implement file operations, metadata extraction, and algorithmic logic.

- **Facade Layer:**  
  `app.py` serves as the backend facade, coordinating `core`, `io`, `cache`, and `models`.

---

### 🪟 GUI Layer (PySide6)

- **GUI Facade (`gui/facade.py`):**  
  The bridge between backend logic (`app.py`) and the Qt event world.  
  It exposes backend functionality via Qt signals/slots.

- **Services (`gui/services/`):**  
  Depend on `gui/background_task_manager.py` and `app.py`.  
  Handle long-running or asynchronous tasks such as scanning, importing, and moving assets.

- **Controllers (`gui/ui/controllers/`):**  
  Depend on `gui/facade.py` and `gui/services/` to **trigger actions**,  
  and on `gui/ui/models/` and `gui/ui/widgets/` to **update views**.

- **Models & Widgets (`gui/ui/models/`, `gui/ui/widgets/`):**  
  Passive components — they should **not** depend on Controllers or Services.  
  Communication happens solely via Qt signals.

- **Tasks (`gui/ui/tasks/`):**  
  Contain `QRunnable` worker classes that depend on functions from `core` and `io`,  
  such as `thumbnail_loader.py` (which uses `ffmpeg.py`).

---

This architecture ensures:
- The backend remains fully testable and independent.
- GUI logic (Controllers) is decoupled from rendering (Widgets) and data state (Models).

---
## 🧩 External Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **ExifTool** | Reads EXIF, GPS, QuickTime, and Live Photo metadata. |
| **FFmpeg / FFprobe** | Generates video thumbnails & parses video info. |

> Ensure both are available in your system `PATH`.

Python dependencies (e.g., `Pillow`, `reverse-geocoder`) are auto-installed via `pyproject.toml`.

---

## 🧪 Development

### Run Tests

```bash
